During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people and FIRST teams were not able to get much engagement due to stay-at-home policies enforced by the government during that time. In order to engage those who have a keen interest in things STEM related, we worked with other FRC teams and renowned presenters from across the globe to engage a worldwide audience stuck at home for 24 hours around the clock.

Check out the STEM youtube channels, you can watch the streams or pick a specialist presenter.
