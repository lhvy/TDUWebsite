Aragung was a compact robot designed to pass under the 16” Low Bar with ease. A robust drivetrain with 8” pneumatic wheels enabled it to cross a variety of defenses and the multi-directional polycord intake both collected boulders and manipulated the cheval de frise. A turreting shooter with a movable hood enabled Aragung to shoot from any position in the courtyard.

Aragung competed at the Northern Lights Regional, the Australia Regional, the Hawaii Regional and the St Louis Championship in the Galileo Division.

Team 3132 won the Australia Regional in 2016.
