Wombot was Team 3132â€™s rookie robot and was designed to play the Breakaway game. It had a low profile to enable it to pass easily through the tunnels and featured an offset four-wheel drivetrain configuration. An intake-kicker mechanism allowed the robot to collect balls and make shots on the goals.

Wombot competed at the Granite State Regional and at the Atlanta Championships in the Galileo Division.
