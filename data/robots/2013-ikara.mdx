Ikara was designed to compete in the Ultimate Ascent challenge. The robot collected frisbees from the feeder station and stored them in the hopper while traveling the field. A powerful two-wheel shooter mounted on a lead screw enabled Ikara to consistently make shots into the high goal. Ikara could also hang from the lowest bar for a bonus 10 points during the end game.

Ikara competed at the Hawaii Regional and at the St Louis Championships in the Galileo Division.
