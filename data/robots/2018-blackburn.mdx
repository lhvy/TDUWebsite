Blackburn was a two-stage elevator robot built for the Power Up challenge. A sprung compliant wheel intake collected and aligned power cubes which could then be outtaked forwards or sideways. Pivoting hooks enabled the robot to climb independently, or a carbon-fibre wing could be deployed for a fast, safe buddy climb.

Blackburn competed at the Southern Cross Regional, the South Pacific Regional, the Silicon Valley Regional and the Houston Championship in the Carver Division.
