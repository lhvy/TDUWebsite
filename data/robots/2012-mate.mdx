MATE And The Engineers competed in the Rebound Rumble Challenge. A dual intake allowed for the rapid collection of game pieces and the flywheel shooter was oriented perpendicular to the drivetrain to allow for easier alignment. A deployable arm lowered the bridges in preparation for the endgame.

MATE competed at the Orlando Regional and at the St Louis Championships in the Curie Division.
