Thatâ€™s Not A Knife (TNAK) was built on a C-base kit chassis and designed to play the Logomotion game. The rack-and-pinion lift and multi-jointed arm were designed to hang the logo pieces on the scoring grid. The robot also featured a mini-bot capable of scoring tower points during the endgame.

TNAK competed at the Hawaii Regional and at the St Louis Championships in the Galileo Division.
