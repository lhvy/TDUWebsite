Built for the 2023 "Charged Up" season of the FIRST Robotics Competition, Nurung is a robot designed to be highly versatile when it comes to scoring, capable of scoring low medium and high with both types of game pieces.

Nurung, meaning "arm" in the local first nations peoples' dialect, is the centerpiece of the robot, driven by a frankly insane gearbox that allows it to rotate a full 270 degrees whilst weighing a massive ~7kg. This gearbox only becomes more important as the arm extends to the full length (allowing scoring the high position). 

The gearbox has a trully astounding ratio of 400:1 reducation, risking tipping the robot when the arm goes over too fast.

Using a standard 6 wheel drivebase in combination with 4 400W motors totalling 1600W of total drivebase power. This makes it an awesome defense bot but also a capable scorer.
